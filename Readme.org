#+TITLE: ergoemacs-status
This is a modernized mode-line (outside emacs this is called a status
bar). This status bar changes its contents based on window size:

#+ATTR_HTML: title="screenshot "
[[./img/small-status.png]]

With a large window, a large amount of information is displayed:

#+ATTR_HTML: title="screenshot"
[[./img/large-status.png]]

You can select or deselect what is shown in the menu-bar.

This configuration is saved for the next emacs session.

** Changing the order of the status bar components
You can change the display order of any component by Alt+clicking and
then dragging the element around.

The element you select will be displayed and changed as you move your mouse.

For example Alt+clicking on the linux icon, highlights the encoding
section of the mode-line or status bar:

[[./img/status-select.png]]

By dragging, you can then move the element:

[[./img/status-select-move.png]]

This configuration is saved for the next emacs session.

** Hiding/displaying minor-modes

By default, the ergoemacs-status hides minor modes based on the size
of your window.  However, you can permanently hide by clicking on the
mode.  A "Hide" menu item will be displayed if hidden it can be
displayed (or even shown) by the up arrow on the side of the
minor-mode list.

This configuration in saved for the next emacs session.
